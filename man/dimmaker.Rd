\title{Specify dimension for an Episteme API query}
\usage{
dimmaker(dimension, mapping)
}
\arguments{
\item{dimension}{A named dimension required by the dataset being used for analysis (e.g. "Occupation").}

\item{mapping}{This may take the form of the atomic "asIdentity" if all possible individual items are required with
no relabelling, or else a data frame with two columns: \code{name} sets labels for \code{code} which refers to the
geographic, industry, occupation or other codes used to categorise data within Episteme. Where one label is used for
multiple codes, \code{dimmaker} will merge them to form a hybrid category.

If you want to pass a map with multiple codes to some of the labels, use a tibble with a list column for \code{code} and
then pass each label a sequence of the form \code{c("1211", "1212")}.}
}
\value{
A prepared list identifying the dimension and supporting mapping, ready to organise a data pull query.
}
\description{
Takes a data frame of names and codes along a dimension and specifies them ready for an Emsi Episteme data pull.
